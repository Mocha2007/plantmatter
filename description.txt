A mod to add plants, to allow synthesis of unavailable resources. Has small additions to the campaign tree, and new walls, towers, production blocks, and enemies. Mindustry is too industrial! It has too much mining!

It needs more... nature! :D

Current Features:
 - Plant matter (produced by trees and seed collectors, as versatile as copper in vanilla)
 - Sap liquid (partial replacement for oil)
 - Wood walls (small and large)
 - 4 new production blocks to use/produce your plantmatter
 - the woodchuck turret, a slower, weaker, higher-damage version of the Duo
 - Two new maps on the campaign trail!
 - Four new plant-themed enemies!

Planned Features:
 - Expand the campaign trail more to fully utilize the new items
 - More plant-themed enemies, including the wood sprite, ent, and spriggan.

Notes:
 - I haven't done extensive testing yet, so the balance might still be off a bit. Please tell me your experience with this mod! Too easy? Too hard? Just right? Anything is helpful!

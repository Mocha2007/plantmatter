A mod to add plants, to allow synthesis of unavailable resources. Has a small addition to the campaign tree, and new walls, towers, and production blocks. Mindustry is too industrial! It has too much mining! It needs more... nature! :D

Current Features:
 - Wood walls
 - 2 production blocks to use/produce your plantmatter
 - the woodchuck turret, a slower, weaker, higher-damage version of the Duo
 - A new map on the campaign trail!

Planned Features:
 - Expand the campaign trail to fully utilize the new items
 - Wood sprite, ent, spriggan enemies.
 - Sap liquid (replacement for oil)

Notes:
 - I haven't done extensive testing yet, so the balance might still be off a bit. Please tell me your experience with this mod! Too easy? Too hard? Just right? Anything is helpful!
